1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ArnavSaikia/v-original-music-player.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project folder:  
   ```bash
   cd v-original-music-player
   ```

## Usage

- Use the search bar to find songs by name or artist.  
- Click play to start streaming the selected song.  
- Use next and previous buttons to navigate through songs.  
- Jamendo doesn't have an extensive library so you may wanna search up their website for choice of songs. For usage purposes, I'd recommend trying "I Believe" by SOLIP, "Lounge Lo-fi" by LOWTONE MUSIC and "My Garden" Michael Ellis.
